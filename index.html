          <div class="about-container">
            <p>Jeff's artistic curiosity was piqued at a young age when he watched his grandfather paint. 
                He was inspired by his grandfather's courage and artistry, and he began to explore different forms of art, including photography, video editing, graphic design, and 3d modelling.</p>
            <br>
            <p>He found that art was a way to communicate his emotions, thoughts, and views on life.
            He believed that art had a communicative capacity that could transcend words. For him, art was not just a representation of reality, but also a way to go beyond it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Furthermore, he has been accepting art commissions to support himself financially. He creates custom artworks for clients who appreciate his unique style.
            By taking on these commissions, he not only earns money but also gains valuable experience and connects with people who admire his work. 
            This allows him to sustain his artistic practice while making a positive impact on others through his art.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently, he is pursuing a university degree in digital animation. He believes that this will help him to become a better artist and to inspire others with his work.</p>
